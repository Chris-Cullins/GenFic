# GenFic
Just a temp repo where I was playing with Tensorflow. 

Current model is 2 LSTM layers, with relu activation, then a dropout layer, then a standard Dense layer, with a softmax activation on the end. 

Currently reads in all works I could get from Gutenberg for Edgar Allan Poe, and spits out a generated paragraph resulting from that training.
